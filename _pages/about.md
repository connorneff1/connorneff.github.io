<h1 style="text-align: center;">Connor Neff</h1>

Hi there! I'm an Economics PhD Candidate at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville. [My research](https://neffconnor.github.io/research/) utilizes tools from industrial organization, natural resource modeling, and applied micro-economics to study questions related to energy and water.  

**I am on the 2025-26 Job Market**. My CV can be found [here](https://neffconnor.github.io/cv/).  

Outside of economics, I dedicate much of my time to [climbing](https://neffconnor.github.io/climbing/) and [surfing](https://neffconnor.github.io/surfing/).  

Feel free to contact me at connor.neff [at] utk.edu
